# smartglasscontroller
A shield for Arduino Mega to control 5 smartglass break out boards
This shield was made to work together with the smart glass controller breakout boads: https://github.com/OBauck/smart-glass-controller-breakout

It consists of 5 CAT connectors, one DMX output and a RTC module.

Created for my KORO commission for Drammen Tinghus 2023.

The files are made with KiCad 7.0
The boards where fabricated at JLCPBC using the files in the Production folder
